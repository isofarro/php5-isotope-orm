PHP5 Isotope ORM
================

A flexible schema-based object-model store. This is very much experimental and a prototype of a few ideas of clean and simple object data stores.

* Input and output are simple PHP data-value objects
* Virtual/variable functions to query/filter object model
* Schema based on object structure, so can relationally map to other SQL tables
* Define object schemas declaratively or procedurally
* Introspect an object to automatically generate a basic/raw object schema
* Object schema is persistent
* Schemas can be refined, altered or adapted; add in new indexes
* Support tree-like object structures
* Support network-like object structures

Currently the actual datasource is a PDO-compliant database.


Success looks like this:

	$json = <<<JSON
		{
			"name":  "Joe Bloggs",
			"email": "joebloggs@example.com",
			"communities": [ "buzz", "twitter", "facebook", "yahoo" ]
		}
	JSON;
	
	$newSubscriber = json_decode();
	
	$orm = new IsotopeOrm($ormConfig);
	$subscribers = $orm->getModel('subscriber');
	$subscribers->store($newSubscriber);
	
	// Later on...
	$twitterUsers = $subscribers->getSubscribersByCommunities('twitter');
	// Lists, amongst others, Joe Bloggs
